# Color Movies Starter Project

This is the starter project for my tryout at Raywenderlich.com

Note:

This project requires an API Key from the "Moview Reviews API" from the NYTimes.

Please get one for free here:

https://developer.nytimes.com/signup

After that, open the **NYTimesApi.kt** file under the **service** package and replace `<key>` with the API key that you received. 

For any questions feel free to contact: aldo2122@outlook.com
